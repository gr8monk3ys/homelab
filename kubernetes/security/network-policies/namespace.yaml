    Network Policy Strategy for Homelab
    ====================================

    1. Database Isolation: Only allow connections from their respective services
    2. Sensitive Services: Restrict to ingress controller only
    3. Infrastructure: Allow necessary control plane communication
    4. Default Deny: Applied per-namespace for defense in depth
